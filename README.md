# R-Code
* Pairwise HSD: a function to create a data frame containing pairwise HSD comparisons/tests including the difference in means, lower and upper confidence interval limits, and p-values of the comparisons. It also provides the mean of each group being compared. Returns a data frame.
* Random Forest PIs: a function to calculate and return prediction intervals for random forests of class ranger. These prediction intervals are not for quantile random forests. Outputs a data frame containing the predicted value and lower and upper prediction interval limits. Works for Mac and Linux users. 
* CategoricalToNumeric: convert a categorical variable or a combination of categorical variables to numeric variables by using an adjusted log likelihood ratio.
